# Introduction

## What are Agents?

**Agents** are AI programs that execute tasks autonomously. They solve problems by running tools, accessing knowledge and memory to improve responses. Unlike traditional programs that follow a predefined execution path, agents dynamically adapt their approach based on context, knowledge and tool results.

Instead of a rigid binary definition, let's think of Agents in terms of agency and autonomy.

* **Level 0**: Agents with no tools (basic inference tasks).
* **Level 1**: Agents with tools for autonomous task execution.
* **Level 2**: Agents with knowledge, combining memory and reasoning.
* **Level 3**: Teams of specialized agents collaborating on complex workflows.

If this is your first time building agents, [follow this guide](/agents) and then dive into more advanced concepts.

## Example: Research Agent

Let's create a research agent that can search the web using DuckDuckGo, scrape the top links using Newspaper4k and write a research report for us. Ideally we'll use specialized tools (like Exa) but let's start with the free tools first.
