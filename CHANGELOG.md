## Commit Summary
feat: Implement Analysis Engine component for analyzing documents with LangGraph and GPT-4o

This change implements the Analysis Engine component, which is responsible for analyzing documents using LangGraph with GPT-4o. The component includes functions for configuring LangGraph workflows, analyzing documents, extracting key concepts and implementation patterns, and synthesizing information across documents. Unit tests verify the functionality, and the main application is updated to analyze the downloaded documents.
