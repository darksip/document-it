## Commit Summary
feat: Implement Report Generator component for creating implementation guidelines

This change implements the Report Generator component, which is responsible for transforming analysis results into clear, structured markdown documents that provide implementation guidelines. The component includes functions for generating topic guidelines, creating cross-references between related topics, and generating an index document. Unit tests verify the functionality, and the main application is updated to generate implementation guidelines from analysis results.
