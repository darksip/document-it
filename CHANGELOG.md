## Commit Summary
feat: Implement Document Processor component for downloading and organizing documents

This change implements the Document Processor component, which is responsible for downloading, storing, and organizing all documents referenced in the llms.txt file.

Unit tests verify the functionality, and the main application successfully downloads and organizes the referenced documents.
