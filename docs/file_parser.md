# File Parser Component

## Purpose
The File Parser component is responsible for extracting URLs and other relevant information from the downloaded llms.txt file. This component must interpret markdown-formatted content, extract links, and validate them for further processing.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Parse the llms.txt file to extract all markdown links
2. Identify document hierarchies and categories based on markdown headers
3. Extract additional metadata (titles, descriptions) when available
4. Filter and validate extracted URLs
5. Support various markdown link formats

### Technical Requirements
1. Use robust regex patterns or dedicated markdown parsing
2. Handle malformed content gracefully
3. Normalize extracted URLs (handle relative vs. absolute paths)
4. Preserve hierarchical relationship between documents

## Interface Design

### Key Functions

```python
def parse_markdown_links(content: str) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """
    Extract all markdown links from the provided content.
    
    Args:
        content: The markdown content to parse
        
    Returns:
        A list of dictionaries, each containing:
        - url: The URL extracted from the link
        - text: The link text
        - context: The surrounding context (e.g., header section)
        
    Raises:
        ParseError: If the content cannot be parsed properly
    """
```

```python
def extract_document_structure(content: str) -> Dict[str, List[Dict]]:
    """
    Extract the document structure including headers and sections.
    
    Args:
        content: The markdown content to parse
        
    Returns:
        A dictionary representing the document structure, with headers as keys
        and lists of document references as values
        
    Raises:
        StructureError: If the document structure cannot be determined
    """
```

```python
def validate_urls(urls: List[str], base_url: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Validate a list of URLs and normalize them if needed.
    
    Args:
        urls: List of URLs to validate
        base_url: The base URL to use for relative paths
        
    Returns:
        A list of dictionaries with validated and normalized URLs,
        including metadata about each URL (valid, absolute, content_type)
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If URLs cannot be validated
    """
```

## Error Handling

The component should handle:
1. Malformed markdown content
2. Missing or invalid links
3. Incomplete hierarchical information
4. Duplicate links

## Dependencies
- Regular expressions library
- Optional: `markdown` or `mistune` for more robust parsing
- URL validation utilities

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests with various markdown formats
2. Test parsing of malformed content
3. Test hierarchical extraction with complex documents
4. Test URL normalization and validation

## Integration Points
- Receives content from the Web Connector component
- Provides structured document references to the Document Processor component

## Implementation Notes
- Consider using a dedicated markdown parser instead of regex for complex content
- Implement a fallback mechanism for identifying links if standard parsing fails
- Document the exact format of the extracted data structures for downstream components
