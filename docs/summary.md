# Global Context Management - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

When accessing deep links in the documentation, we currently lose the global context of what the product is, its purpose, and main features. This results in analyses that lack awareness of the overall system, producing guidelines with incomplete context.

## Solution Overview

We've designed a comprehensive solution that:

1. **Extracts global context** from the root/landing page
2. **Follows important concept links** to build a complete understanding
3. **Maintains and enriches context** as more documents are analyzed
4. **Integrates context** into all analyses and generated guidelines

## Key Components

### 1. Enhanced HTML Parser
- Preserves document structure during parsing
- Intelligently prioritizes content sections
- Extracts metadata and navigation structure

### 2. Intelligent Link Crawler
- Analyzes and scores links based on relevance
- Controls crawling depth (only 1 level deep)
- Consolidates information from multiple pages

### 3. Multi-Stage Context Analyzer
- Extracts product info, features, and terminology
- Validates and ensures context completeness
- Provides fallback mechanisms for incomplete data

### 4. Context-Aware Analysis
- Integrates global context into document analysis
- Filters context to most relevant information
- Updates prompts to avoid repetition while maintaining awareness

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Focus | Timeline |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Core Infrastructure | Week 1 |
| 2 | HTML Parsing | Week 1-2 |
| 3 | Link Analysis & Crawling | Week 2 |
| 4 | Context Analysis | Week 3 |
| 5 | Integration | Week 3-4 |
| 6 | Testing & Optimization | Week 4 |

## Key Benefits

1. **Coherent Guidelines**: Generated guidelines will have awareness of the overall product
2. **Improved Accuracy**: Analyses will better understand the relationships between components
3. **Progressive Enrichment**: Context quality improves as more documentation is analyzed
4. **Robust Processing**: Fallback mechanisms ensure context is always available

## Success Criteria

- Global context successfully extracted from root pages
- Relevant concept links identified and followed
- Context properly incorporated in all analyses
- Guidelines clearly reference the overall product context
- System handles edge cases (missing pages, poor documentation)
