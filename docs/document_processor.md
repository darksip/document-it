# Document Processor Component

## Purpose
The Document Processor component is responsible for downloading, storing, and organizing all documents referenced in the llms.txt file. It manages the efficient retrieval of documents, ensures they are properly stored, and prepares them for analysis.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Process multiple document URLs efficiently
2. Download and store documents in an organized structure
3. Track document metadata and relationships
4. Handle different document formats consistently
5. Support batch processing for performance

### Technical Requirements
1. Implement parallel or asynchronous downloads when appropriate
2. Create a consistent storage structure that preserves document relationships
3. Extract and store document metadata
4. Track download status and handle retries for failed downloads

## Interface Design

### Key Functions

```python
def process_document_batch(urls: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Process a batch of document URLs, downloading and organizing them.
    
    Args:
        urls: A list of dictionaries containing URL information and metadata
        
    Returns:
        A dictionary with results of the batch processing, including:
        - success_count: Number of successfully downloaded documents
        - failed_urls: List of URLs that failed to download
        - document_paths: Mapping of URLs to local file paths
        
    Raises:
        BatchProcessError: If the batch cannot be processed
    """
```

```python
def organize_by_category(documents: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, List[str]]:
    """
    Organize documents by their categories based on the document structure.
    
    Args:
        documents: A dictionary mapping URLs to document information
        
    Returns:
        A dictionary mapping categories to lists of document paths
        
    Raises:
        CategoryError: If documents cannot be categorized
    """
```

```python
def get_document_metadata(document_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Extract metadata from a document.
    
    Args:
        document_path: Path to the document
        
    Returns:
        A dictionary containing document metadata
        
    Raises:
        MetadataError: If metadata cannot be extracted
    """
```

## Storage Structure

The document processor should create and maintain the following directory structure:

```
data/
├── raw/                  # Raw downloaded files
│   ├── category1/
│   │   ├── doc1.md
│   │   └── doc2.md
│   └── category2/
│       └── doc3.md
└── metadata/             # Document metadata files
    └── document_index.json  # Index of all documents with metadata
```

## Error Handling

The component should handle:
1. Download failures for individual documents
2. Storage errors
3. Metadata extraction failures
4. Category organization issues

## Dependencies
- Web Connector component for download functionality
- File system operations
- JSON for metadata storage

## Testing Strategy
1. Test batch processing with various document types
2. Test organization functionality with different category structures
3. Test metadata extraction from various document formats
4. Test error handling for download failures

## Integration Points
- Uses the Web Connector component for downloading documents
- Provides organized documents to the Analysis Engine component

## Implementation Notes
- Consider implementing a progress tracking system for batch downloads
- Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed downloads
- Store document relationships to preserve the hierarchical structure from the llms.txt file
