# Web Connector Component

## Purpose
The Web Connector is responsible for establishing connections to web resources and downloading content from specified URLs. This component is the foundation of the document retrieval system, enabling the application to access the llms.txt file and all referenced documents.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Connect to the base URL (https://docs.agno.com/llms.txt) to retrieve the initial file
2. Support downloading of various document formats (markdown, text, HTML)
3. Handle HTTP errors gracefully with appropriate retry mechanisms
4. Maintain session state if needed for consecutive requests
5. Respect website rate limits and robots.txt guidelines

### Technical Requirements
1. Use asynchronous requests where appropriate for performance
2. Implement timeout handling to prevent hanging connections
3. Support proper HTTP headers and user agent identification
4. Validate downloaded content to ensure integrity

## Interface Design

### Key Functions

```python
def connect_to_website(url: str) -> ConnectionObject:
    """
    Establish a connection to the specified URL.
    
    Args:
        url: The URL to connect to
        
    Returns:
        A connection object that can be used for subsequent requests
        
    Raises:
        ConnectionError: If the connection cannot be established
    """
```

```python
def download_file(url: str, destination: Optional[str] = None) -> Tuple[str, bytes]:
    """
    Download a file from the specified URL.
    
    Args:
        url: The URL of the file to download
        destination: Optional local path to save the file to
        
    Returns:
        A tuple containing the filename and the file content as bytes
        
    Raises:
        DownloadError: If the file cannot be downloaded
        ValidationError: If the downloaded content is invalid
    """
```

```python
def get_content_type(url: str) -> str:
    """
    Determine the content type of a resource without downloading it.
    
    Args:
        url: The URL to check
        
    Returns:
        The content type as a string (e.g., "text/markdown")
        
    Raises:
        ConnectionError: If the URL cannot be accessed
    """
```

## Error Handling

The component should implement these error scenarios:
1. Network connectivity issues
2. Server errors (5xx responses)
3. Client errors (4xx responses)
4. Timeout handling
5. Content validation failures

## Dependencies
- `requests` library (or `httpx` for async support)
- Optional: `aiohttp` if using async functionality

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests with mocked responses for various HTTP status codes
2. Test against real URLs with different content types
3. Test error handling with simulated network failures
4. Test timeout behavior

## Integration Points
- Provides downloaded content to the File Parser component
- Implements interfaces that will be used by the Document Processor component

## Implementation Notes
- Prefer using the `requests` library for simplicity unless performance requirements dictate otherwise
- Consider implementing a simple caching mechanism to avoid redundant downloads
- Log all connection attempts and responses for debugging purposes
