# Analysis Engine Component

## Purpose
The Analysis Engine component is responsible for analyzing the collected documents using LangGraph with GPT-4o. It extracts key information, identifies implementation patterns, and prepares structured data for the report generation phase.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Integrate with OpenAI's GPT-4o model
2. Configure and manage LangGraph workflows
3. Process documents individually and synthesize information across documents
4. Extract key concepts, implementation patterns, and guidelines
5. Categorize and structure the analyzed information

### Technical Requirements
1. Implement efficient prompt engineering for accurate analysis
2. Handle API rate limits and implement appropriate backoff strategies
3. Manage token usage efficiently
4. Structure output data consistently

## Interface Design

### Key Functions

```python
def setup_langgraph_workflow() -> Any:
    """

    Returns:
        A configured LangGraph workflow object
        
    Raises:
        ConfigurationError: If the workflow cannot be configured
    """
```

```python
def analyze_document(content: str, context: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze a document using the LangGraph workflow with GPT-4o.
    
    Args:

        context: Optional context information (e.g., document metadata, category)
        
    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the analysis results, including:
        - key_concepts: List of important concepts in the document
        - implementation_details: Extracted implementation guidelines
        - code_patterns: Any code patterns or structures identified
        - related_topics: Related topics mentioned in the document
        
    Raises:
        AnalysisError: If the document cannot be analyzed
    """
```

```python
def extract_key_concepts(analysis: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Extract key concepts from an analysis result.
    
    Args:
        analysis: The analysis result from analyze_document
        
    Returns:
        A list of dictionaries, each representing a key concept with:
        - name: Concept name
        - description: Concept description
        - importance: Relative importance rating
        - related_concepts: List of related concepts
        
    Raises:
        ExtractionError: If concepts cannot be extracted
    """
```

```python
def synthesize_topics(analyses: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Synthesize information across multiple document analyses to create topic overviews.
    
    Args:
        analyses: A list of analysis results from analyze_document
        
    Returns:
        A dictionary mapping topics to synthesized information
        
    Raises:
        SynthesisError: If topics cannot be synthesized
    """
```

## LangGraph Configuration

The LangGraph workflow should be configured with the following components:

1. **Document Reader**: Processes raw document content
2. **Concept Extractor**: Identifies key concepts and patterns
3. **Implementation Analyzer**: Extracts implementation details
4. **Relationship Mapper**: Maps relationships between concepts
5. **Topic Synthesizer**: Combines information across documents

## GPT-4o Prompt Design

Prompts should be designed to extract specific information types:

1. **Concept Identification Prompt**: Identifies main concepts and their importance
2. **Implementation Pattern Prompt**: Extracts implementation guidelines and code patterns
3. **Relationship Mapping Prompt**: Identifies relationships between concepts
4. **Summarization Prompt**: Creates concise summaries of implementation approaches

## Error Handling

The component should handle:
1. OpenAI API errors and rate limits
2. Token limit exceeded issues
3. Unclear or ambiguous analysis results
4. System context limitations

## Dependencies
- `openai` library
- `langgraph` framework
- `langchain` integration components
- `langchain-openai` for OpenAI integration

## Testing Strategy
1. Test analysis with sample documents of various complexity
2. Test synthesis with related document sets
3. Test error handling with simulated API failures
4. Evaluate quality of extracted information

## Integration Points
- Receives documents from the Document Processor component
- Provides analysis results to the Report Generator component

## Implementation Notes
- Implement an efficient token usage strategy to handle large documents
- Consider chunking documents if they exceed token limits
- Cache analysis results for efficient reuse
- Implement appropriate logging for monitoring API usage
